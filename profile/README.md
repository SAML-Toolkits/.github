## Pay it Forward: Support SAML and Strengthen Open-Source Security

The toolkits are trusted authentication libraries used by startups and enterprises alike.

But security doesn't happen in a vacuum. Vulnerabilities in authentication libraries can have widespread consequences.
Maintaining open-source security requires continuous effort, expertise, and funding. By supporting SAML-Toolkits, you’re not just securing your own systems—you’re strengthening auth security globally.

**How you can help**

* Sponsor SAML-Toolkits: [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/SAML-Toolkits)
* Contribute to secure-by-design improvements.
* Responsibly report vulnerabilities.

Security is a shared responsibility. If the SAML open source toolkits have helped your organization, please
consider giving back. Together, we can keep authentication secure.
